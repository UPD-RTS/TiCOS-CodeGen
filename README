The goal of this README is to provide quick start guide to use the Code Generator. 
The complete Code Generator documentation can be found in the doc directory.

The Code Generator use the GNOME XML Library (Libxml2). 
You can download and install it from http://www.xmlsoft.org/

To compile the Code Generator program just type:

make

To generate the “generated-code” directory (and all files required to run an example) just type:

./code-gen  xml/[file.xml] 


XML files
---------
In the xml directory you can find some XML file example you can use to generate the user application for TiCOS

arinc653-1event-O1.xml
application with: one partition, one arinc653 event, O(1) scheduler

arinc653-1event-O1_split.xml
application with: one partition, one arinc653 event, O(1) scheduler with task split

arinc653-1part.xml
application with: one partition, two threads, O(1) scheduler

arinc653-2parts-FPPS.xml
application with: two partitions, two threads for each partition, FPPS scheduler

arinc653-3parts.xml
application with: three partitions, two threads for each partition, O(1) scheduler

arinc653-blackboards.xml
application that invokes arinc653 blackboards services, O(1) scheduler

arinc653-buffers.xml
application that invokes arinc653 buffers services, O(1) scheduler

arinc653-sampling-queueing.xml
application that invokes arinc653 sampling and queuing port services, O(1) scheduler

arinc653-mix.xml
application that invokes arinc653 ports, buffers, blackboards and events. O(1) scheduler.


If you want to generate a different user application code you can modify an existing XML file or create a new one.
